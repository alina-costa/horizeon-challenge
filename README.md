Given a starter code, I made modifications to:
- Improve organization
- Improve accesibility
- Involve more semantic HTML elements
- Correct anything that was not functioning properly 

All links are now functinoing properly, both HTML and CSS files are easier to read, and the site will be more compatible in terms of accessibility.
