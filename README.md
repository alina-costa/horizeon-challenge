# horizeon-challenge
Horiseon is a search engine optimization service devoted to helping bussinesses become more visible to the appropriate customers.  

I corrected a few errors in the original code, such as repairing any links that were not redirecting the user to the appropriate destination. I also added alt descriptions to the images, gave the website a more descriptive title, and restructured the code to optimize it for accessibilty purposes and also to make it easier for other developers to read and understand should any further changes be made.
